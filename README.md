react-luna

Statement
react-luna is a self-sufficient React component library designed to be a durable foundation for personal applications. It targets a clean, lunar aesthetic with a default light and dark theme that can be overridden at the project level after installation.

Goals
- Provide a complete set of reusable UI primitives and layouts.
- Keep the library independent from third-party UI frameworks.
- Ship a default Lunar theme with light and dark variants.
- Allow downstream projects to override theme tokens and component styling.

Non-goals
- Recreating Vue or Vuetify patterns.
- Depending on external UI component libraries.

Design Approach
- Theme tokens first, component styles derived from tokens.
- Accessible defaults and consistent spacing/typography scales.
- Clear layering of primitives, composites, and templates.

Tooling
- React for component implementation.
- Storybook for interactive component exploration and configuration.
